She rose to fame as the star of the long-running sitcom Moesha and broke new ground as the first Black actress to portray a Disney princess (Cinderella) on screen. She starred as a Cover Girl, and captivated audiences on Broadway. Brandy is adoringly known as “the Vocal Bible,” and her decades-long career has more than proven that she deserves the title. With a singular voice that swells from subdued and reserved to powerful and emotive, she has enraptured audiences since her 1994 self-titled debut. The quadruple Platinum album was steeped in relatable R&B, and served as an introduction to her signature sound. The projects that followed—from 1998’s Never Say Never, which spawned the Grammy-winning hit \"The Boy Is Mine\" to 2020’s B7—further cemented her status as a genre-defining icon. Brandy’s ability to bring love and loss to light can be traced to a voice that she controls like an instrumentalist. A generational talent who is revered by her peers and fans alike, Brandy brought her wisdom and experience to her most recent Holiday album, Christmas with Brandy. The album which was released in 2023 is sure to become a Holiday staple for generations to come. When she’s not dazzling listeners by diving deep into the R&B bag that made us fall in love with her from the very beginning, she is working on projects like Descendants: The Rise of Red, now streaming on Disney+ and her upcoming yet to be titled memoir to be released in 2025.",
